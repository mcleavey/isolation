Isolation Game Agent -- Christine Payne
\section{Heuristic Analysis}
Initially, we consider several different types of heuristics.  Custom, Custom\_2, Next\_Step, and Stage all use a function check\_future\_steps(), 
which looks ahead to consider how long a run the player would have if they chose this move.  This is similar to the overall minimax search, except that 
it ignores moves the opponent might make, and it also does not make a copy of the board at each step. This is an effort to make a fast estimate as to 
whether a move would leave open several future moves or would be near a dead end.

Next\_Step uses this heuristic for the entire game (I expected this would perform badly, since early on few moves would be near a dead end, and it would
give little insight how to pick a good one).  Custom, Custom\_2, and Stage are all similar where they start out using a Distance From Center metric, then as the 
game progresses they use the number of legal moves (for the player minus for the opponent) and then end with this check\_future\_steps\(\) heuristic.  Progression
through the game is determined by the number of empty spaces on the board.


Diff\_Dist, Dist\_Diff, and Diff\_dist\_sum all use combinations only of Dist (distance from the center) and Diff (number of legal moves for the player minus for the opponent).  Distance is measured either by traditional Pythagorean (the square of x and square of y) or by counting the number of steps from the middle
square (number of squares up or down, plus number of squares left or right).

Diff\_Dist uses Diff for the first half of the game, and Dist for the second.  Dist\_Diff is the opposite. Diff\_dist\_sum uses a weighted sum of the two
throughout the whole game.

Prior to these tests, we also had tried variations of weighting own legal moves remaining vs opponent legal moves remaining (inside of what we call Diff). We did not find any repeatable advantage over a simple OWN\_MOVES - LEGAL\_MOVES

Because we found a large amount of variation in each tournament run, we changed the number of games to be 100 or 80 per face-off, and in some cases we
ran the whole tournament twice.

\newpage
\begin{verbatim}

Two different tournaments of 100 games per match. Win rates:
                 First tournament    Second tournament
AB_Improved            66.7%            67.3%
Custom                 68.0%            67.4%
Custom_2               67.1%            65.4%
Diff_Dist              58.3%            59.6%
Dist_Diff              66.6%            64.7%
Diff_dist_sum          68.0%            68.4%
Next_Step              62.3%            63.1%
Stage                  68.9%            67.4%

  
\end{verbatim}

At this point, we stop considering the worst performing heuristics (Diff\_Dist, and Next\_Step). We try out a variation of
Stage.  The main heuristics stay the same, but we adjust weightings in each.


\begin{verbatim}
One tournament of 100 matches per face-off
AB_Improved             64.7%
Custom                  64.1%
Diff_Dist_sum           67.0%
Mod_Stages              66.3%

\end{verbatim}

We consider if it is better to use squared distance (Pythagorean distance) as in the heuristic given to us in sample\_players rather than counting the number of steps away from the center.

\begin{verbatim}
One tournament of 60 matches per face-off
AB_Improved             66.9%
Diff_Dist_sum           70.2%
Diff_SqDist             63.3%

\end{verbatim}

At this point, Diff\_Dist\_sum seems to be the only heuristic that is consistently out-performing AB\_Improved. We now focus on the relative weights
for Diff and Dist.   Initially we used a positive version of Dist (meaning a higher score is given to squares further from the center). While this is counter-intuitive, we noticed that AB\_Center consistently performed well, so we aimed to include some of that success.  (Since the minimax algorithm looks several steps ahead, we thought perhaps looking for a corner square many steps ahead pushes one to choose a central square early on.)   Now in these variations, we consider weighting
Dist negatively (giving a higher score to squares closest to the center).


\begin{verbatim}
60 Matches
Diff+ (w*Dist)
------------------------------------
Name                w       Win Rate
AB_Improved                  68.1%
DD_pt_8            .8        65.5%				
DD_half            .5        65.5%				
Diff_dist_sum      .3        66.7%				
DD_subt           -.3        68.6%				
DD_full_subt      -.6        72.4%				


\end{verbatim}

Now we explore making Dist even more heavily negative. We also add a variation of the Stages algorithm (where we us diff, dist,
and check\_future\_steps() at different stages of the game).

\begin{verbatim}
60 Matches
AB_Improved         64.5%
DD_full_subt        66.2%       (w = -.6)
DD_dbl_sub          66.7%       (w = -2)
Adv_stage           71.2%



\end{verbatim}
From this, Adv\_stages looks very promising. However, when we run two back-to-back comparisons to confirm this finding, we see this was just a fluke:

\begin{verbatim}
                   

80 Matches each tournament
               First tournament   Second tournament
AB_Improved         68.0%               69.6%
Adv stages          65.2%               67.1%



\end{verbatim}

At this point, we return to a simple combination of Dist and Diff.  It seems the added computational time from creating a more complicated look ahead is not
worth it.   Finally we decide to stay with a simple and fast heuristic. It remains only to determine the best weighting of Dist and Diff. We run one last
set looking at a few other weights we haven't yet considered, and then chart average success vs the weight of Dist.

We graph results vs weighting of Dist in Figure \ref{fig:dd-combinations}.  Each win rate is normalized by the AB\_Improved win rate for that tournament. If the agent was run in multiple 
tournaments, we take an average win rate, weighted by number of games in that tournament.
